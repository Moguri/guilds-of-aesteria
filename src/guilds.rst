Adventuring Guilds
******************

Overview
========

* Result of treaty so nobles could retain power in exchange for aid in unification war
* "Old world" guilds are former noble houses
* "New world" guilds are those formed after the treaty
* Guilds do not swear fealty to local lords, but life is easier if they respect them
* Organization and management of guilds and leagues are up to their respective heads

  * Leagues may influence how member guilds are run
  * "Old world" guilds/leagues tend to be run by descendant of the former noble houses (e.g., leadership is hereditary)

Leagues
=======

* Guilds can join leagues for support
* League to help new guilds

  * Despite relatively weak member guilds, this guild holds a far amount of influence and respect
  * Most view it as a noble endeavor to train new-comers and help perpetuate the guild system
  * Others see new guilds as unfit and see the league as diluting prestige of the guild system

    * People with this view tend to be descendants of the former noble houses (i.e., "old world')

* One or two leagues closely tied with former noble houses
* Specialist leagues (e.g., for certain job types)?

Titles
======

  * Prince of the Guilds - head of the guild system, non-royal prince, elected by electors
  * League Lords - head of a league of guilds, duke-level title, electors come from this group
  * Guild Master - head of a guild, count- or baron-level title depending on guild prestige
  * Guild Knight - a member of a sanctioned guild
  * Titles are not hereditary
  * Titles are not formally retained upon leaving a position, but may be used out of respect (e.g., for former league heads)

    * May want to consider more official emeritus titles
